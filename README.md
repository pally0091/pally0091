## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a web developer with a good knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I did work with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, TailwindCSS etc. With JavaScript I can do functional job for website or web application. I think I have everything that a frontend developer should have. Can work with React and React Router.
I have some little knowledge in backend like nodeJS, express, cors etc. I am trying to improve this.
It is my passion to learn about any new technology. As a technician or web developer I try to keep myself up to date. I think it is very important for my personal and career life that I keep myself prepared for any situation. I like to treat people well and be friendly. I like to work together as well as at work.
